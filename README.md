# AI Engineer Course

This repository is a record of my journey to becoming an AI Engineer.
I will continuously add code, projects, and notes as I learn Python, machine learning, and web development.

## Overview
This repository is used to store practice code and small projects created during my AI engineering studies.
Each project focuses on hands-on learning and building practical skills.

## Environment
- OS: Windows 
- Python: 3.11
- Editor: VS Code

## Repository Structure

## What I Learned
- How to create and manage a GitHub repository
- How to write a basic README.md
- The importance of documenting learning progress

## Future Plans
- Add Python basic programs
- Build small applications
- Gradually create AI and web-based projects

## Day01 - Python Basics

### Files
- day01/day1_hello.py : print の練習
- day01/q1_calc.py : 2数の四則演算（input / int / f-string）
- day01/q2_grade.py : 条件分岐で成績判定（if / elif / else）
- day01/q3_sum_loop.py : 複数入力の合計・平均・最大（for / range）
- day01/q4_guess_game.py : 数当てゲーム（while / random）
- day01/q5_menu_app.py : メニュー型アプリ（総合演習・終了制御）

### What I learned
- Variables / types (int, float, str)
- Operators (+, -, *, /)
- if / elif / else
- for / while
- input() and basic validation
- basic program design (menu, loop, exit conditions)
